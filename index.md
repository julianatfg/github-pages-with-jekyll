# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about books.

### Wrapped up in books

It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight\
I could see into your window although you're far away\
You were racing in a car\
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for\
What you have in mind\
If he is up for what you have in mind

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard\
But I never want to leave you\
We've never had a fight\
You should never split a pole\
You should never split at all\
I wish I had two paths that I could follow\
I'd write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there\
I will wrap my hands around you\
I know it will be fine\
We've got a fantasy affair\
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare\
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books\
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer's hastening on\
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city\
But I've been unfaithful\
I've been travelling abroad\
We've got a fantasy affair\
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare\
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books\
Our inclinations are hidden in looks
